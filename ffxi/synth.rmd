## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r maketable, echo=FALSE}

SkilName <- data.frame(1:12, "jn"=c("素","見習"))
SkilName

JSkilName <- c(
  "素人" ,"見習","徒弟", "下級職人", "名取", "目録", "印加", "高弟", "皆伝", "師範",
  "高級職人", "高級職人＋"
)

```
